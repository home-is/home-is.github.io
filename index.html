        <h2>Twenty Years in Tahoe</h2>

      <p>Twenty years ago in April 1997 I visited Lake Tahoe for the first time to decide if it would be my new home. Some high school friends and I talked about moving up to Big Bear in Southern California where we liked to snowboard close to home when somebody suggested going somewhere better like Lake Tahoe. I had never been so it made sense to check it out first. I drove into the Tahoe Basin via Mt. Rose Highway, saw the lake and was sold. I officially moved to Tahoe Labor Day weekend the same year.</p>
<p>There was no long term plan but life worked for me here. I moved to Tahoe for the winters but really fell in love with summers too as many transplants do. I was able to maintain jobs with decent pay and benefits with my last job ending as a senior vice president at a software company. I met my other half, Kyle, in 2008 who has been in Tahoe off and on since the late 90s. And in August 2013 we were able to buy a condo without carrying a mortgage. It’s tiny but has a peek lake view, backs to forest land, is close to the Tahoe Rim Trail, and we can ski to Heavenly’s Boulder Lodge from our back door during a big winter just like this 2016/17 season. Worse case I walk to the end of the driveway and catch the free bus.</p>
<p>I spend my free time skiing on powder days (yes, I hung up my snowboard), hiking, mountain biking, camping, backpacking, and taking my dogs to the lake with the person I love in one of the most beautiful places in the world. So why would I want to leave? Tahoe is a much different place now than 1997. I’m sure it’s even more different for those who came well before me. Tourist crowds are great for local business but there’s a lack of solitude Kyle and I miss. In a few short years the parking lot for our condo building went from very few cars (with the exception of 4th of July and New Year&#39;s weekends) to overflowing most weekends and sometimes on weekdays. I rarely go to the beach in the summer anymore unless it’s in the early morning hours and I dread skiing at the resorts for fear of getting hurt in the lift line. This season a guy almost destroyed my knee trying to join his friends ahead of me who were too impatient to wait for their buddy outside the lift line. I expect these things living in a resort town, but lately it’s just been too much too often and hard to escape. Kyle and I will travel two hours or more on the weekends to find peace.</p>
<p>Kyle and I had been tossing around the idea of selling our condo when our realtor e-mailed last month to say there was low inventory and asked if we’d like to sell. This made the idea real. We purchased our condo as a foreclosure during the last dip in the market so we know we will make a healthy profit. So as of right now we’re committed to officially listing this June 2017 and our realtor will keep our place as a pocket listing until then.</p>
<p>But selling our condo presents a problem. Where to next? Purchasing another place in Tahoe doesn’t make sense due to the rising cost in home prices, and decent rentals are very hard to find. So our crazy idea is to hit the road full-time in a van or RV. Kyle currently owns a Chevy Express AWD van we’ve enjoyed using for camping, road tripping, and exploring. But we really are clueless about living full-time in a van or RV. We decided to create homeis.blog to share our experience as we decide on a mobile shelter and hit the road. Maybe it will inspire you to make a change, or appreciate where you are at. If you’re considering the mobile life, share your story in the comments below. Or if you already are living the full-time van or RV life, share stories about the hard times so we’re informed!</p>
